### Usage: 

```
[saliency, az, el, az2, el2] = meshSaliencyPipeline(Mesh)
```

`saliency` is the saliency value corresponding to each vertex in the input mesh.

`az`, `el` are the spherical coordinates for the most salient viewpoint.

`az2`, `el2` are the spherical coordinates for the least salient viewpoint.
